Dear [Support Team/Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am having trouble logging into my Heroku account. I know my user ID and password, but I am unable to figure out how to obtain the verification code required for the "ID Verification" step. Additionally, I accidentally performed a password reset once. I am using an iPhone and have downloaded the Authenticator app, intending to use it for future logins.

I apologize for any inconvenience and would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue.

Thank you and best regards,

Yuki Sato
